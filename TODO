======
 - some api enhancement required for making usbk c++ api. this api will
   be used in qusbk.
 - make libusbk fully c source since no need to use c++

 - make variables fixed sizes (eg. use int32_t or int64_t instead of int (except file descriptors) )

 - c++ bindings can be written, but first qusbk project must be started!
