NAME
       usbk - linux cli program of usbk


SYNOPSIS
       usbk [-adhisTtXv] [-c NEWPASSWORD] [-F KEYSIZE] [-f KEYFORMAT] [-k KEYNO] [-m KEYNAME] [-n DEVICELABEL] [-p PASSWORD] [-u DEVICENAME] [-x NEWKEY]


DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page explains the usbk which is command line interface (CLI) program . This program allows user to manage USBK(s) plugged to the host system. To execute this program, you must have supe‐
       ruser privilege.

       The USBK is a device which protects user's critical data on USB Flash Disk and USB External Hard Drive by AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).  the two models of USBK are available as  A101  and  A103.
       A101 has one encryption key and A103 has also 3 encryption keys.


OPTIONS
       -a, --activate
              activates  USBK with specific encryption key. After activation, USBK is ready to encrypt and decrypt user's data during data transfer with selected encryption key. This option must be used with
              -p and -u options.

       -c NEWPASSWORD , --newpasswd=NEWPASSWORD
              sets new password for USBK as NEWPASSWORD. NEWPASSWORD must be minimum 4 characters long and not exceed 16 characters. It may contain three different types of characters: letters,  numbers  and
              special  characters such as punctuation marks, etc.. This option can be used for setting first password or changing password after first usage. For changing password, this option must used with
              -p option. Moreover, after the set of new password, random encryption key(s) is generated by USBK and assigned on it. That’s why, it is strongly  recommended  to  set  encryption  key(s).  This
              option must be used with -u option.

       -d, --deactivate
              deactivates  USBK.  Deactivation is tantamount to removing BackDisk. It is equivalent in effect with removing BackDisk although it is plugged-in the USBK. Before deactivating USBK, user must be
              sure that the disks of BackDisk are unmount ; otherwise deactivation without unmounting could corrupt the data on the devices. Moreover, user should deactivate the USBK, before leaving the USBK
              plugged-on host system, changing some settings, activating USBK with another key(Valid for A103 model). This option must be used with -u option.

       -F KEYSIZE , --key-size=KEYSIZE
              declares  key size for changing key. This option defines the size of encryption key in bit size and KEYSIZE parameter is either "128" for 16 byte or "256" for 32 byte. The default value of this
              option is "256". This option selects the type of AES as AES-128 or AES-256 in the meantime. So, this option can be used with -x option.

       -f KEYFORMAT , --key-format=KEYFORMAT
              declares key format for changing key option. KEYFORMAT parameter is either "d" for decimal form or "t" for text form. The default value of this option is "d". Encryption key in ‘Text’ type must
              be  characters  long  with  letters,  numbers and special characters such as punctuation marks, etc. Decimal is formed of numeric digits between 0 and 255, each digit separated with a dot. This
              option can be used with -x option.

       -h, --help
              shows the help page of USBK linux CLI program.

       -i, --show-info
              shows more detail information of a specific USBK which is declarated with -u option. This information contains USBK device name, BackDisk device name, product, model,  serial  number,  firmware
              version, device label, status, retry number, existance of BackDisk, autoactivation feature, max. key capacity and names of keys.

       -k KEYNO , --key-no=KEYNO
              selects  a  specific  key which has KEYNO key number to manage USBK with this key. This option may be used for activation, autoactivation or changing encyption key.A101 model has one encryption
              key so this option may not be used. On the other hand, A103 model has 3 encryption keys. This option is necessary for A103 model. If the option is not used, its default value  is  1  and  first
              encryption key is selected by default.

       -m KEYNAME , --keyname=KEYNAME
              changes keyname of selected key to KEYNAME. The max. lenght of KEYNAME is 12 characters. This option can be used with -x option and the -u option is mondatory for this option.

       -n DEVICELABEL , --label=DEVICELABEL
              sets  new  device  label  for  USBK  as DEVICELABEL. The device label of USBK is used to separate this USBK from others.  This option must be used with -p option. Besides, the status of USBK is
              “Force Remove” after changing device label.  In this status, no setting can not be done by user. User must unplug USBK from Host system and then re-plug for appying this change  and  doing  any
              settings. This option must be used with -u option.

       -p PASSWORD , --passwd=PASSWORD
              declares user's password to manage a specific USBK as PASSWORD. This option is used for authantication with other options. The -u option is mondatory for this option.

       -s, --show-devices
              shows  device list of USBKs plugged to host system and gives some information related to them as USBK device name, BackDisk device name, product, model, serial number and firmware version. USBK
              device name and BackDisk device name auch as "sdd" and "sdc" are same as device names of USBK and BackDisk in linux operating system ("/dev" directory).  Moreover, USBK device name is  used  to
              manage USBK and mount virtual disk of USBK. Besides, the BackDisk device name is used to mount BackDisk.

       -t, --enable-auto
              disables autoactivation feature of USBK. This option must be used with -u and -p options.

       -T, --disable-auto
              enables  autoactivation  property of USBK with a selected key. With Auto-Activation property, USBK is configured to automatically activate when plugged in a HostSystem. So,  USBK can be used on
              hostsytems which do not have any user interface for password entry. When Auto-Activation is enabled, USBK does not ask for password confirmation to verify user. Thence, it can be used  directly
              on  test  &  measurement equipments such as oscilloscope, EKG, etc.  If BackDisk plugged-on your USBK in “Auto-Activation Enabled” is lost, any user can access the data on your BackDisk when he
              plug in the computer as no password is asked to verify user. Just carry only USBK when “Auto-Activation Enabled” for the security of the data on BackDisk. This option must be used with  -u  and
              -p  options, and the -k option is optional.

       -u DEVICENAME , --dev=DEVICENAME
              declares  a  USBK with DEVICENAME to manage. DEVICENAME is device name of the USBK device in linux host system such as "sdd" and can be learnt by -s option. This option must be used with -u and
              -p options.

       -X, --change-key-with-random
              sets new key for selected key number of USBK as random-generated key. USBK has random generator and this option provides that the key is generateed randomly and set by USBK and then shows it to
              user for writing down.  This option must be used with -u and -p options and the -k option is optional.

       -x NEWKEY , --change-key=NEWKEY
              sets  new  key  for  selected key number of USBK as NEWKEY. After setting/changing your encryption key(s), usee has to write down encryption key(s) in note for future reference, but remember to
              keep it confidential. There’s no way to recover encryption key(s) as they are never exported or displayed during usage of USBK. A lost of encryption keys results in lost of  data  on  BackDisk.
              Therefore,  it is very important that user remember the encryption key(s) or store it in a safe place. This option must used with "-p" password option. The "-k", "-F" and "-f" are not mondatary
              for this option. If these options are not used, the default values of "-k", "-F" and "-f" are "1", "256" and "d".

       -v, --ver
              shows the version of USBK linux CLI program.
