NAME
       usbk - linux cli program of usbk


SYNOPSIS
       usbk [options]


DESCRIPTION
       This manual page explains the usbk which is command line interface (CLI) program . This program allows user to manage USBK(s) plugged to the
       host system. To execute this program, you must have superuser privilege. 

       The USBK is a device which protects user's critical data on USB Flash Disk and USB External Hard Drive by AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).
       the two models of USBK are available as A101 and A103. A101 has one encryption key and A103 has also 3 encryption keys.  


OPTIONS
       -s, --show-devices
              shows device list of USBKs plugged to host system and gives some information related to them as USBK device name, BackDisk device 
              name, product, model, serial number and firmware version. USBK device name and BackDisk device name auch as "sdd" and "sdc" are same
              as device names of USBK and BackDisk in linux operating system ("/dev" directory). Moreover, USBK device name is used to manage USBK 
              and mount virtual disk of USBK. Besides, the BackDisk device name is used to mount BackDisk. 


       -u DEVICENAME , --dev=DEVICENAME
              declares a USBK with DEVICENAME to manage. DEVICENAME is device name of the USBK device in linux host system such as "sdd" and can 
              be learnt by -s option. 


       -i, --show-info
              shows more detail information of a specific USBK which is declarated with -u option. This information contains USBK device name, 
              BackDisk device name, product, model, serial number, firmware version, device label, status, retry number, existance of BackDisk, 
              autoactivation feature, max. key capacity and names of keys. 


       -c NEWPASSWORD , --newpasswd=NEWPASSWORD
              sets new password for USBK as NEWPASSWORD. NEWPASSWORD must be minimum 4 characters long  and not exceed 16 characters. It may 
              contain three different types of characters: letters, numbers and special characters such as punctuation marks, etc.. This option
              can be used for setting first password or changing password after first usage. For changing password, this option must used with 
              -p option. Moreover, after the set of new password, random encryption key(s) is generated by USBK and assigned on it. That’s why, 
              it is strongly recommended to set encryption key(s)  


       -p PASSWORD , --passwd=PASSWORD
              declares user's password to manage a specific USBK as PASSWORD. This option is used for authantication with other options.


       -a, --activate
              activates USBK with specific encryption key. This option must be used with -p and -k options. After activation, USBK is ready to 
              encrypt and decrypt user's data during data transfer with selected encryption key. 


       -d, --deactivate
              deactivates USBK. Deactivation is tantamount to removing BackDisk. It is equivalent in effect with removing BackDisk 
              although it is plugged-in the USBK. Before deactivating USBK, user must be sure that the disks of BackDisk are unmount ; otherwise 
              deactivation without unmounting could corrupt the data on the devices. Moreover, user should deactivate the USBK, before leaving 
              the USBK plugged-on host system, changing some settings, activating USBK with another key(Valid for A103 model). 


       -n DEVICELABEL , --label=DEVICELABEL
              sets new device label for USBK as DEVICELABEL. The device label of USBK is used to separate this USBK from others. This option 
              must be used with -p option. Besides, the status of USBK is “Force Remove” after changing device label. In this status, no setting 
              can not be done by user. User must unplug USBK from Host system and then re-plug for appying this change and doing any settings.


       -k KEYNO , --key-no=KEYNO
              selects a specific key which has KEYNO key number to manage USBK with this key. This option may be used for activation, 
              autoactivation or changing encyption key.A101 model has one encryption key so this option may not be used. On the other hand, 
              A103 model has 3 encryption keys. This option is necessary for A103 model. If the option is not used, its default value is 1 
              and first encryption key is selected by default.


       -x NEWKEY , --change-key=NEWKEY
              sets new key for selected key number of USBK as NEWKEY. This option must used with "-p" password option. The "-k", "-F" and "-f" are 
              not mondatary for this option. Is these options are not used, the deault values of "-k", "-F" and "-f" are "1", "256" and "d".Moreover,
              after setting/changing your encryption key(s), usee has to write down encryption key(s) in note for future reference, but remember to 
              keep it confidential. There’s no way to recover encryption key(s) as they are never exported or displayed during usage of USBK. A lost of 
              encryption keys results in lost of data on BackDisk. Therefore, it is very important that user remember the encryption key(s) or store 
              it in a safe place.


       -F KEYSIZE , --key-size=KEYSIZE
              declares key size for changing key. This option defines the size of encryption key in bit and KEYSIZE parameter is either "128" for 
              16 byte or "256" for 32 byte. The default value of this option is "256". This option selects the type of AES as AES-128 or AES-256 
              in the meantime.

       -f KEYFORMAT , --key-format=KEYFORMAT
              declares key format for changing key option. KEYFORMAT parameter is either "d" for decimal form or "t" for text form. The default value of 
              this option is decimal. Encryption key in ‘Text’ type must be characters long with letters, numbers and special characters such as
              punctuation marks, etc. Decimal is formed of numeric digits between 0 and 255, each digit separated with a dot.


       -m KEYNAME , --keyname=KEYNAME
              changes keyname of selected key to KEYNAME. This option must be used with -x option. The max. lenght of key name is 12 characters.
              

       -X, --change-key-with-random
              sets new key for selected key number of USBK as random-generated key. USBK has random generator and this option provides that the 
              key is generateed randomly and set by USBK and then shows it to user for writing down.    


       -t, --enable-auto
              enables autoactivation property of USBK with a selected key. With Auto-Activation property, USBK is configured  to automatically activate
              when plugged in a HostSystem. So,  USBK can be used on hostsytems which do not have any user interface for password entry. When 
              Auto-Activation is enabled, USBK does not ask for password confirmation to verify user. Thence, it can be used directly on test & 
              measurement equipments such as oscilloscope, EKG, etc. If BackDisk plugged-on your USBK in “Auto-Activation Enabled” is lost, any user
              can access the data on your BackDisk when he plug in the computer as no password is asked to verify user. Just carry only USBK when 
              “Auto-Activation Enabled” for the security of the data on BackDisk.


       -T, --disable-auto
              disables autoactivation feature of USBK.


       -v, --ver
              shows the version of USBK linux CLI program.


       -h, --help
              shows the help page of USBK linux CLI program.
